# Introduction

This document describes and specifies the a RESTful alternative to the WHOIS implementation offered by DK Hostmaster A/S. It is primarily aimed at a technical audience and the reader is required to have prior knowledge of the WHOIS protocol and possibly DNS registration.

The WHOIS RESTful service is optimized for structured querying in contrast to it's text-based origin implementing the [WHOIS service](https://github.com/DK-Hostmaster/whois-service-specification) responding on port 43,

With the introduction of the registrar model, the WHOIS capabilities are being extended so these can serve information on registrars.

The registrar model, [description here conceptually][concept], gives registrars the option to manage a customerâ€™s .dk domain name if the customer would prefer this. This is referred to as "registrar management". The alternative allowing the customer to manage their domain name themselves is referred to as "registrant management".

# The .dk Registry in Brief

DK Hostmaster is the registry for the ccTLD for Denmark (dk). The current model used in Denmark is based on a sole registry, with DK Hostmaster maintaining the central DNS registry.

<a id="features"></a>
# Features

The service implements the following features.

- Domain name inquiry
- Host name inquiry
- Support for multiple encodings (see: [Encoding](#encoding) below)
- Support for both IPv4 and IPv6
- Dates in [ISO:8601] format

<a id="available-environments"></a>

## Available Environments

DK Hostmaster offers the following environments:

| Environment | Role | Policies |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- |
| production  | production | This environment is the production environment for the DK Hostmaster WHOIS API Service |
| sandbox     | development | This environment is intended for client development towards the DK Hostmaster WHOIS API Service |

For information on what service and specification is applicable and available, consult the [DK Hostmaster WHOIS Service Wiki][WIKI]

For use please see the section on [Test Data](#test-data).

<a id="production-environment"></a>
### Production Environment

- requests made to this environment will reflect live production data

Production is available at: `whois.dk-hostmaster.dk` port `43`

<a id="sandbox-environment"></a>
### Sandbox Environment

- Queries made to this environment will reflect data only available in the isolated sandbox environment, please see the [sandbox environment specification](https://github.com/DK-Hostmaster/sandbox-environment-specification) for details.
- Please additional data please, see the section on [Test Data](#test-data).

<a id="implementation-limitations"></a>
# Implementation Limitations

<a id="localization"></a>
## Localization

In general the service is not localized and all WHOIS information is provided in English.

Dates are provided in in [ISO:8601][ISO:8601] format.

<a id="media-type--format"></a>
## Media-type / Format

The service only supports **JSON**.

<a id="encoding"></a>
## Encoding

The service supports the following encodings:

- UTF-8
- Punycode [RFC:5891][RFC:5891]
- ASCII
- URI encoding [RFC:3986][RFC:3986]

<a id="rate-limiting"></a>
## Rate Limiting

We only allow one request per second per source IP.

If rate is higher that acceptable, we return: `503 Service Temporarily Unavailable`

We reserve the right to adjust the rate limiting in order to provide a high quality of service.

<a id="security"></a>
## Security

The service is only available under **TLS 1.2**

<a id="service"></a>
# Service

The service is available at:

- `https://whois-api.dk-hostmaster.dk`

The service offers four APIs, one specialized for each entity type:

- domain (domain name)
- host (hostname/name server)

And a generic API:

- query

Which relays to the specific service APIs for the mapped entity being one of the ones listed above.

The service requires that the accept header is specified to be `application/json`, all of the below examples demonstrates this using the command line utilities `curl` or `httpie`.

As described under Implementation Limitations, the service only supports **JSON**. This has to be specified using the **HTTP** header: `Accept`

If the header is unspecified, not specified correctly or specified to an unsupported format, the service will error with HTTP status code: `415`

```bash
$ curl https://whois-api.dk-hostmaster.dk/domain/eksempel.dk
"Unsupported Media Type"
```

Correct specification using `curl` should be as follows:

```bash
$ curl --header "Accept: application/json" https://whois-api.dk-hostmaster.dk/domain/eksempel.dk
{"createddate": "1999-05-17T00:00:00+02:00","dnssec": "J","domain": "eksempel.dk","domain_encoded": "eksempel.dk","domain_type": "V","message": "OK","nameservers": {"auth01.ns.dk-hostmaster.dk": {"domain": "eksempel.dk","domain_encoded": "eksempel.dk","hostname": "auth01.ns.dk-hostmaster.dk","hostname_encoded": "auth01.ns.dk-hostmaster.dk"},"auth02.ns.dk-hostmaster.dk": {"domain": "eksempel.dk","domain_encoded": "eksempel.dk","hostname": "auth02.ns.dk-hostmaster.dk","hostname_encoded": "auth02.ns.dk-hostmaster.dk"}},"paiduntildate": "2022-06-30T00:00:00+02:00","periodqty": "5","public_deletedate": null,"public_domain_status": "A","registrant": {"city": "KÃ¸benhavn S","countryregionid": "DK","name": "DK HOSTMASTER A/S","phone": null,"street1": "Ã˜restads Boulevard 108, 11.","street2": null,"street3": null,"useridtype": "V","zipcode": "2300"},"status": 200}
```

And for `httpie`

```bash
$ http https://whois-api.dk-hostmaster.dk/domain/eksempel.dk Accept:'application/json'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: max-age=1, no-cache

}
```

<a id="domain"></a>
## domain

This service returns data on a given domain name.

As of version 2.X.X of the service, admin/proxy information is no longer part of the response data, same goes for name server administrators/zone contact handles.

As of version 3.X.X of the service, registrant user-id/handle information is no longer part of the response data.

As of version 4.X.X of the service:

- information on a domain name offered from a waiting list is available.
- registrar information is included in the response data.

With the new registrar information included where applicable the responses can and will vary depending on the model chosen for administration of the given domain name.

If the domain name is under registrar management, a registrar data section is included:

```json
"registrar": {
    "city": "KÃ¸benhavn S",
    "countryregionid": "DK",
    "is_public": false,
    "logo": "",
    "name": "DK Hostmaster A/S",
    "phone": "+45 33 64 60 60",
    "street1": "Ã˜restads Boulevard 108, 11.",
    "street2": null,
    "street3": null,
    "url": "www.dk-hostmaster.dk",
    "useridtype": "V",
    "zipcode": "2300"
},
```

NB: The above example is constructed.

The fields are:

- `city`, city part of address
- `countryregionid`, country part of address
- `is_public`, flag indicating if the registrar is listed in the public registrar listing
- `logo`, URL to public logo
- `name`, name
- `phone`, public phone number
- `street1`, first street part of address
- `street2`, second street part of address
- `street3`, third street part of address
- `useridtype`, internal type indicating whether the entity is an association, company, individual or public organization
- `zipcode`, zipcode part of address

Do note that the listing on the public registrar listing and have address information redacted from public interfaces is not that same.

If the domain name is under registrar management, but the registrars address information is not public, the section look as follows:

```json
"registrar": {
    "is_public": false
}
```

If the domain name is under registrant management, not registrar data is included.

So the responses can be divided into two groups based on the registrar data section

- Registrant managed, section is not included
- Registrar managed, section is included, excluding address data if the address is not public
